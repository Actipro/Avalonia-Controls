# Overview

There are an enormous feature set in Actipro Docking & MDI related to docking windows.

## Docking Window States

There are three states in which docking windows can be: auto-hide, docked, and document.  Docking windows can be in these states even when they are in a floating dock host.

See the [Docking Window States](docking-window-states.md) topic for more information.

## Lifecycle and Docking Management

The lifecycle of a docking window includes its creation, specifying initial size and/or size restrictions, providing a default open location, opening, moving to various states, docking to various locations, closing, and destruction.  This topic covers how to perform all of those operations.

See the [Lifecycle and Docking Management](lifecycle-and-docking-management.md) topic for more information.

## Docking Window Capabilities

One of the best features of Actipro Docking & MDI is the number of options that are available to you as a developer.  Many options control the behaviors and capabilities of the docking windows and can be set at a global level as well as at a docking window instance level.

See the [Docking Window Capabilities](docking-window-capabilities.md) topic for more information.

## Docking Window Events

There are a number of events to which you can attach to know when various actions occur to docking windows.

See the [Docking Window Events](docking-window-events.md) topic for more information.

## Docked Tool Windows

Tool windows in [docked state](docking-window-states.md) appear docked in containers around an optional workspace within their dock host.  When two or more tool windows are in the same container, tabs allow for selecting which one is visible.

See the [Docked Tool Windows](docked-tool-windows.md) topic for more information.

## Auto-Hidden Tool Windows

Tool windows in [auto-hide state](docking-window-states.md) show tabs along a tray area on the side of their dock host.  When a tab is clicked, the related tool window's content is displayed in an animated popup.

See the [Auto-Hidden Tool Windows](auto-hidden-tool-windows.md) topic for more information.

## Floating Dock Hosts

Docking windows can be dragged to float, meaning appear in a floating dock host that can move independently above the dock site's primary dock host.

See the [Floating Dock Hosts](floating-dock-hosts.md) topic for more information.

## Contextual Content

Contextual content, such as buttons or status indicators, can be displayed throughout the docking window UI within tabs and title bars.

See the [Contextual Content](contextual-content.md) topic for more information.

## Fixed Tool Windows

By turning off various options on a specific tool window, you can completely prevent it from being moved and can keep it "fixed" within a tool window layout, while still allowing other tool windows to be docked around it.

See the [Fixed Tool Windows](fixed-tool-windows.md) topic for more information.

## Menu Customization

All context menus displayed by this product can be customized or replaced entirely before they are shown to the end user.

See the [Menu Customization](menu-customization.md) topic for more information.

## Switchers

Switchers are used during <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, etc. key presses to easily navigate between open documents and tool windows.

See the [Switchers](switchers.md) topic for more information.
