# Overview

Actipro Bars includes features for menus and menu items beyond what the related native controls offer.

## Context Menus

The `BarContextMenu` control implements a context menu that can host any Bars controls intended for menu contexts, including split menu items or graphically-rich menu galleries, and supports other advanced features like MVVM configuration of its items.

See the [Context Menus](context-menus.md) topic for more information.

## Menu Customization

Bars controls like ribbon and standalone toolbars define built-in menus and/or auto-generated context menus to support the default functionality of the control.  These menus can be easily customized to add, remove, or update the default menu items.

See the [Menu Customization](menu-customization.md) topic for more information.
