# Third-Party Software

Actipro Avalonia controls are built specifically for the Avalonia framework and, as such, have a dependency on the following open source libraries:

- [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) - Provides the cross-platform UI framework.
- [.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet) - Provides the cross-platform runtime framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Actipro control libraries only reference open source libraries, and the corresponding [NuGet Packages](nuget.md) do not distribute any third-party software.

*In the event that Actipro Software LLC accidentally failed to list a required notice for third-party software, please bring it to our attention by [contacting support](support.md).*
