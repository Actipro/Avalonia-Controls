## Licensing Support

If you are experiencing a problem with the licensing of a purchased product, please read the [Licensing](licensing.md) topic.  It has valuable information on licensing and how to resolve any issues you may encounter.

If after reading that topic and following its directions you still cannot resolve the licensing issue, please contact us at [support@actiprosoftware.com](mailto:support@actiprosoftware.com).

## General Product Support

If you need to obtain support on one of our products, you have two options:

1. Post a message in the Actipro Software [support forums](http://www.actiprosoftware.com/community/forums).

1. E-mail [support@actiprosoftware.com](mailto:support@actiprosoftware.com) for assistance.

We highly recommend the first support option since it will enable other users to participate in the discussion.

Licensed customers of our products will receive the highest priority of support.

Please visit the [Actipro Software](http://www.actiprosoftware.com/) web site to sign up for our .NET newsletter or to see our other .NET products.
