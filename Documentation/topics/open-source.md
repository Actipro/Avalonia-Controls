# GitHub Open-Source

Actipro hosts an open-source Actipro Avalonia controls repository on GitHub:

[https://github.com/Actipro/Avalonia-Controls](https://github.com/Actipro/Avalonia-Controls)

## Repository Contents

While the repository doesn't contain the source code for controls, it does contain a lot of related material including:

- The Sample Browser application project's source code
- This documentation's source Markdown topic files

## Support and Contributing

For support of our closed-source UI control products, please use the support options described in the [Support](support.md) topic.  Do not submit a GitHub issue for control product support.

We welcome contributions by our customers!  If you have an idea for improving our samples or documentation (basically anything whose source is in the repository), please submit a GitHub issue to discuss the idea with us.  We may then ask you to create a pull request with code changes for the idea.
