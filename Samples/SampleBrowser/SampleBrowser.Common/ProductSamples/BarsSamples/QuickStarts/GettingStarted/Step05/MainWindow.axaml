RIBBON GETTING STARTED SERIES - STEP 5

STEP SUMMARY:

	This step is a big advancement over the previous steps. Until now, only small
	concepts have been introduced with each step. This step will build upon all of those
	smaller concepts to populate more tabs and controls in the Ribbon. The stand-alone
	Help button is replaced by an editor that will better showcase the new commands that
	are added in this step and future steps.
	
CHANGES SINCE LAST STEP:
	
	The stand-alone "Help" button was removed and replaced with an instance of a
	TextBox editor control that will receive focus when the window is opened.
	
	See the "SampleWindowViewModel.cs" file for details on a new "Home" tab with "Undo"
	and "Clipboard" control groups. The following guidelines apply to adding support for
	new Ribbon configurations:
	
		For every new Ribbon Tab...
			- Add to the Tabs collection in SampleWindowViewModel.
	
		For every new Ribbon Group...
			- Add key to SampleBarControlKeys.
			- Optionally configure collapsed image using SampleBarManager.RegisterImages.
			- Add to the appropriate Ribbon Tab view model in SampleRibbonViewModel.
	
		For every new Ribbon Control...
			- Add key to SampleBarControlKeys.
			- Configure large and/or small images using SampleBarManager.RegisterImages.
			- Configure view model using SampleBarManager.RegisterControlViewModels.
			- Add to the appropriate Ribbon Group in SampleRibbonViewModel.

	Prior sample comments were removed/condensed.
	
EXPECTED OPERATION:
	
	When this sample window is opened, the Ribbon should display "Home" and "Help" tabs with
	the "Home" tab selected. On the "Home" tab will be control groups for "Undo" and "Clipboard".
	Since the "Undo" and "Clipboard" groups contain commands based on CompositeCommand, these
	commands will currently all be disabled until a future step associates these commands with
	the TextBox.
