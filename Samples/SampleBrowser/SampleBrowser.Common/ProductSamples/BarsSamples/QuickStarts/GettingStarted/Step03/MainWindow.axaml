RIBBON GETTING STARTED SERIES - STEP 3

STEP SUMMARY:

	Before we can start adding controls to the Ribbon, we need to establish the supporting
	classes.  This starts by defining unique keys that can be used to refer to each control.
	Then we need need to define a view model that will represent each control.
	
	Refer to 'SampleBarControlKeys.cs' for more information on the string-based keys.
	
	Refer to 'SampleBarManager.cs' for more information on the class that will manage the
	view models for each control.
	
CHANGES SINCE LAST STEP:

	This XAML is fundamentally unchanged by this step.
	
	A new 'SampleBarControlKeys' class was added with a string-based key for the Help control.
	
	A new 'SampleBarManager' class was added. Large and small images were registered for the
	Help control based on the control key. A view model was registered for the Help control
	based on the control key.
	
	Prior sample comments were removed/condensed.
	
EXPECTED OPERATION:
	
	This step laid the groundwork for incorporating view models into the Ribbon, but the
	expected operation (as perceived by the end user) has not changed. In the next step, the
	"Help" button will be migrated to the Ribbon.
	
	When this sample window is opened, a Ribbon control with a default "File" button should be displayed
	along with a "Help" button below the Ribbon. Clicking the "Help" button should display a message.
	Clicking the "File" button should do nothing since a backstage is not currently defined.
