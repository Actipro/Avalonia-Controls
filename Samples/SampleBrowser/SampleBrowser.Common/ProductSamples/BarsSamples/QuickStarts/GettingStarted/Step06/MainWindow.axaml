RIBBON GETTING STARTED SERIES - STEP 6

STEP SUMMARY:

	The ribbon's editor commands (like clipboard operations) must have a command registered with
	them that will be executed when the ribbon command is executed.  In this step, commands are
	defined that encapsulate individual textbox operations which are then registered with the
	composite commands on the ribbon.
	
CHANGES SINCE LAST STEP:
	
	This XAML file is fundamentally unchanged for this step.
	
	Prior sample comments were removed/condensed.
	
	
EXPECTED OPERATION:
	
	When this sample window is opened, the Ribbon should display "Home" and "Help" tabs with
	the "Home" tab selected. On the "Home" tab will be control groups for "Undo" and "Clipboard".
	Since the "Undo" and "Clipboard" groups contain commands that are now property connected to
	the editor, the Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, and Paste controls should exhibit typical behavor
	for an edit control.
	
	Since the "Paste Special" command is not implemented, attempting to select this command
	will display a "Not Implemented" message.  This command was added in a previous step, but it
	could not be accessed since the parent "Paste" command was disabled.
