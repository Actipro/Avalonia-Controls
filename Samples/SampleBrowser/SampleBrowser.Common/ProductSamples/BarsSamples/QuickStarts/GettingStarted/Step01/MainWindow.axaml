RIBBON GETTING STARTED SERIES - STEP 1

STEP SUMMARY:

	A full Ribbon configuration can be complex, so this Getting Started series is designed as a
	sequence of smaller steps to introduce you to the Ribbon control and its features.
	
	This first step establishes the core control structure for hosting a Ribbon control and defining
	window content.
	
	Notes similar to these will also be reflected in the C# code files that accompany each step.
	
CHANGES SINCE LAST STEP:

	This is the first step. In subsequent steps, check here for notes about what changed since the
	previous step.
	
EXPECTED OPERATION:
	
	When this sample window is opened, a Ribbon control with a default "File" button should be displayed
	along with the message "Future window content" below the Ribbon. Clicking the "File" button should do
	nothing since a backstage is not currently defined.

<!--
SAMPLE NOTE 1.1:
	Hosting a Ribbon in a RibbonWindow (instead of a standard Window) will provide a themed experience
	consistent with popular modern applications that typically use a ribbon interface

	SAMPLE NOTE 1.2:
		Placing a RibbonContainerPanel around ar Ribbon will enable animation effects when toggling the
		minimized state as well as additional logic for when a backstage is displayed (which will be
		discussed in a later step)
	
	SAMPLE NOTE 1.3:
		RibbonContainerPanel will automatically locate the child Ribbon control and properly arrange
		it within the panel. All other children will fill the remaining space, similar to how native Grid
		arranges children.
